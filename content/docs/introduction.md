## Background

There is a crisis of nutrition around the world, especially in the United States
where I live. As the inflation of food prices combined with stagnating wages
leads to backbreaking food budgets,
[80% of Americans now consider fast food a luxury because of high prices](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/americans-consider-fast-food-luxury-high-prices).
Combining that fact with people knowing less about cooking than ever before
because of the death of home economics and physical education classes, is it any
wonder that obesity rates are as high as they are; that Ozempic being used
off-label as a "skinny shot" is being prescribed en masse?

It is time for people to relearn how to cook. With this website, I don't want to
just make an archive of my own personal recipes. I also want to help people
understand how their cooking works.

## Me, My Food, And My Goals

This being a github site, I obviously am a programmer on the internet first and
foremost. More relevant to this website, I'm also a United States Army Special
Forces veteran, competitive shooter, martial artist, and rock climber. With all of that physical
activity, I've had to also fill the role of home cook to meet my personal
above-average nutritional needs and I've personally found a lot of enjoyment and
meditation in cooking. Cooking has a widespread reputation of something that is
super laborious, messy, and exhausting. My hope is that you'll give me a chance
to prove that conception wrong with some basic equipment, technique, and
knowledge.

Because of the nutritional needs required to keep up with my activity as a
martial artist and rock climber, most of what's on this website is intended to
be healthy food. Don't let that word scare you. You won't be finding any
unseasoned boiled chicken on plain rice on this website. I want to prove to you
that "healthy" food can be just as delicious as "normal" processed food while
also being cheaper in many instances.

I am also vegetarian for my own personal ethical and health reasons. If you, the
reader, personally eat meat you won't find any judgement from me here. While
meat isn't required for the vast majority of recipes on this website, many of my
dishes can be complemented with the addition of meat. I will highlight some of
those opportunities to the best of my ability in ways that preserve the flavor
and healthiness of the recipe, but given that I've been vegetarian for nearly
half a decade at this point and I'm not going to sample the additions myself, I
will admit I'm starting to get a bit rusty when meat is involved.

## Boring Money Stuff

I am not a recipe blogger, nor am I a professional chef. I am not receiving any
revenue from this site, and write/host it as a passion project. You will never
see any ads, tracking cookies, or affiliate links on this website. Not all of
these recipes are my own creation and I will make a best effort to credit the
original authors whenever applicable and possible. In the interests of quality
control, all recipes on this website have been made by me at least once. I do
not have any sponsors and any product recommendations are my own personal
equipment that I have used and personally recommend.
