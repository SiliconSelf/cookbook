If you have a pressure cooker like an Instant Pot, that'd cook fastest.
Proportions in this recipe are very forgiving; you can put whatever amount of
what you've got and it'd probably turn out just fine. The author of this page
first got this recipe from his mother, who in turn found it
[here](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/instant-pot-taco-pasta/). A few
tweaks have been made, but the recipe is largely unchanged.

## Requirements

{{< tabs tabTotal="4">}} {{% tab tabName="Ingredients" %}}

You will need:

1. 1-2 cups shredded cheese, preferably a Mexican blend
2. 1x can tomato sauce (8-16 fl. oz)
3. 1 lb ground beef, 80% lean or more
4. Miscellaneous spices, e.g. taco seasoning
5. Uncooked medium pasta shells
6. 2 cups beef broth or water

Water is of course easier and cheaper to acquire, but beef broth will taste
better.

For spices, I recommend chili powder, paprika, onion and garlic powders, and
ground cumin.

This recipe contains:

1. Dairy as cheese
2. Gluten and wheat as pasta
3. Red meat as ground beef and optionally beef broth
4. Ethyl alcohol as wine or vinegar in hot sauce (both optional)

I am neither vegetarian nor vegan, so I have not experimented with
vegan-friendly alternatives to the ingredients, but I don't doubt that one could
easily make that work.
