### Cooking The Breadcrumb Topping

1. Melt 1 Tbsp butter in large pan.
2. Add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. This will generally take 2-3 minutes.
3. Season the breadcrumbs with salt and pepper and mix in chives as desired.
4. Wipe out pan with paper towel.

### Cooking The Brussels Sprouts

1. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in the pan used for breadcrumbs.
2. Add brussels sprouts and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are softened and have turned brighter green.
This will generally take around 5 minutes.
3. Season with chili flakes as desired.

### Making The Sauce

1. Melt 2 Tbsp of butter in pot used to cook spaghetti.
2. Whisk in 3.5 Tbsp of flour until a thick paste is formed.
3. Whisk continuously over medium heat until roux turns golden. This will probably take at least 5 minutes.
4. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of milk, stirring until thickened.
5. Add in more milk until desired consistency of sauce is reached.
6. Add in parmesan cheese, herb butter, and cream cheese. Stir until melted.
7. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and chili flakes.

### Combining

1. Add spaghetti, brussels sprouts, lemon zest, remaining chives, and a big squeeze of lemon juice to the sauce pot.
2. Stir pasta cooking water into pot[^1].
3. Simmer pasta with sauce, stirring occasionally, until enough water has cooked off to reach desired consistency.
4. Divide pasta between bowls, cover bowls with breadcrumb topping, and serve.

[^1]: This is done to introduce starches from the pasta to the sauce, helping the sauce adhere to the pasta.
